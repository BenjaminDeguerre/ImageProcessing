# ImageProcessing

A simple program to help create a database from a set of image.
The project was realised with the Desktop Qt 5.7.0 GCC 64bit kit.

Sor far there are two options :

* Extracting ROI from the image and store it to the folder linked to the ROI class
* Selecting ROI, cutting the image down into parts and store the part to the correct folder depending on the ROI class
